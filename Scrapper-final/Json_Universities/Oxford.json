There is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.\n\nEducation\n\nOxford offers more than 350 different graduate degree programmes.\nOxford's research activity involves more than 70 departments, the colleges, more than 1,800 academic staff, more than 5,500 research and research support staff, and more than 6,100 graduate research students.\nUndergraduate and postgraduate Oxford qualifications: certificates, diplomas, advanced diplomas, Master's and Doctoral degrees, offered part-time, in the arts, social sciences, diplomatic studies, human rights law, health care and biomedical sciences.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch carried out by Oxford’s staff, students and alumni has made an enormous impact on the world over the centuries. You can explore some of the more recent examples in the Oxford Impacts case studies and films. These range from impact on culture, business and policy to environment and health.\n\nThe impact of some research is evident immediately, whereas in other cases it can take years, or even decades, before the true value becomes apparent. There are no simple predictors of potential benefit or outcomes, and no single measure of impact. \n\nOverview\nScholarships\nUniversities ranking\nServices\nStudent Life\nStudent insurance\n\nMake sure to cover your health, travel, and stay while studying abroad.
