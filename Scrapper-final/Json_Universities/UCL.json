It was the first university in England to welcome students of any religion or social background, and the first in England to welcome women to university education.

The university was rated second in the UK for research power in the last “Research Excellence Framework (REF 2021).”\n\nUCL’s researchers are continually making an impact on the world we live in; creating headlines across subject areas, locally in the UK and across the globe. UCL's research-based teaching methodology means that research is integrated into many of our degrees and students have the opportunity to make an original contribution to their field of study.\n\nCareer\n\nUCL is the university in London that is most targeted by graduate employers, according to a report compiled by High Fliers Research in The Graduate Market in 2024, the largest and most authoritative annual careers survey of final year students at the UK's 30 leading universities.\n\nGallery\n\nView all\n\nOverview\nScholarships\nUniversities ranking\nServices\nStudent Life\nStudent insurance\n\nMake sure to cover your health, travel, and stay while studying abroad.
